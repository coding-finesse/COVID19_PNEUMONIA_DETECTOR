# X Ray and Pneumonia Detection ðŸ’‰

<ul>
<li>Due to the spike of Covid cases across the world, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed. </li>
<li>We have devised a tool through which we can easily classify a given X-Ray as Covid positive or negative and Pneumonia positive or negative. </li>
<li>X-ray or CT-Scans are used as inputs.</li> 
<li>This is done through a novel deep neural network based model largely inspired by the VGG16 architecture</li>
</ul>
