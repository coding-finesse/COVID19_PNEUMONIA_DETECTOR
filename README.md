<h1 align='center'> X Ray and Pneumonia Detection 💉 </h1>

<ul>
<li>Due to the spike of Covid cases across the world, healthcare systems have been overwhelmed. </li>
<li>We have devised a tool through which we can easily classify a given X-Ray as Covid positive or negative and Pneumonia positive or negative. </li>
<li>X-ray or CT-Scans are used as inputs.</li> 
<li>This is done through a novel deep neural network based model largely inspired by the VGG16 architecture</li>
</ul>


<h2><b>Steps:</b></h2>

<p>
<ol>
<li> Download and extract the zip file </li>
<li> Open the two python programs “covid19_ai_diagnoser.py” and
“covid19_ai_diagnoser_optimal_model_architecture” in any python id. We have used Spyder</li>
<li>Run “covid19_ai_diagnoser.py” and you should see the desired results and figures like given below. </li>
<li> PG version of confusion metrics are saved under the name “covid19PneumoniaCM.jpg'' and “pneumoniaCM.jpg”</li>
</ol>
